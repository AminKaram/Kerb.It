          <h4>About Us</h4>
          <p class="center-align">We are a team of students at Imperial College London.
            We're currently in second year, and we made this application as part of our
            summer term project. We chose this idea because we felt the current
            waste disposal industry really needed modernisation, which gave us an
            opportunity to create a product with a lot of potential market value.
            We also felt implementing Kerb.It would be very challenging, yet rewarding
            and educational for us. Apart from being passionate programmers we like to party loads,
            so if you ever need to contact us, just go to Imperial College Union or Belushi's in
            Hammersmith and you are bound to find one of us.</p>
